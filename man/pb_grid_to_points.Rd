\title{Convert a probability raster to weighted points}
\usage{
pb_grid_to_points(prob_raster, weightsCol = "layer", drop_zeros = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{prob_raster}{RasterLayer with probability mass per cell (sums to 1).}

\item{weightsCol}{Output weight column name (default "layer").}

\item{drop_zeros}{If TRUE, drops zero and NA cells.}
}
\value{
\code{sf} POINT with one row per nonzero cell.
}
\description{
Converts a RasterLayer of probability mass into an sf point set located at cell centers,
with a weight column equal to the cell probability.
